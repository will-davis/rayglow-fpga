Move GLSL rendering off the Pi 5 and onto `ubuntu-server`'s RTX 4080, keeping the Pi as a
vblank-paced DPI framebuffer and leaving the ECP5 translation layer completely untouched.

## 1. Why

The Pi 5's VideoCore VII is **51.2 GFLOPS FP32**. At 384×128 with `scale=2` (768×256 =
196,608 px) at 60 Hz that is ~4,340 FLOP/px of theoretical peak, and realistically
~1,300 FLOP/px sustained. A moderate Shadertoy raymarcher — 64–128 march steps, 4–6 extra
SDF evals for normals, a soft-shadow march — costs **5,000–50,000 FLOP/px**. The wall is
short by roughly 4–40× on exactly the shaders worth showing.

The RTX 4080 is **~48 TFLOPS FP32, ~950×** the Pi. Frigate uses ~20%, leaving ~38 TFLOPS
against a workload needing ~0.02. The GPU is not the constraint after this change; nothing
is.

**The counter-intuitive result (§5): this architecture is *lower* latency than today**,
because the render stage currently dominates the budget and collapses from 25–50 ms to
~1 ms, while the added network hop costs ~1.7 ms.

## 2. Target architecture

## 3. What changes, and what emphatically does not

| Component | Change |
|---|---|
| `rayglow-fpga` gateware | **None.** Not one line. |
| DPI signalling / modeline | **None.** Same 12.5 MHz, same 384×480 clamp, same crop. |
| INTERFACE-CONTRACT.md | Doc-only clarification (§4) — the contract is host-agnostic. |
| `sender/sender.py` | **None.** One env var: `RAYGLOW_HOST` → `192.168.1.101`. |
| `rayglow/render/egl.py` | **Add** an NVIDIA device-platform path alongside the Mesa one. |
| `rayglow/render/` output | **Add** a network frame sink. `--output kms` stays as fallback. |
| Pi software | **New**, small: a receiver + `KmsOut`. Drops the GL stack entirely. |

That the gateware is untouched is not a happy accident — it is the interface boundary
doing its job. The FPGA was specified as *a monitor*, and a monitor does not care which
machine is driving it. This is the strongest available evidence the boundary was drawn in
the right place.

**The Pi gets simpler, not more complex.** It no longer needs Mesa, EGL, GLES, or the
shader pipeline — just a socket and a memcpy. `KmsOut.blit()` already takes a plain
`(H, W, 3) uint8` array and owns everything hard (vblank wait, XRGB8888 swizzle, stride,
clipping), so the receiver is ~150 lines against an already-proven sink.

## 4. Git strategy

**No forks. One feature branch, in `rayglow` only.**

A fork solves a *permissions* problem — you don't have one, you own both repos. What a
fork would buy you is a second remote to keep in sync forever, in exchange for nothing.
Forking *both* repos would be worse still: it doubles the sync burden and manufactures a
cross-repo version-matching problem, which is precisely what INTERFACE-CONTRACT.md exists
to prevent. And since `rayglow-fpga` receives zero code changes, a fork of it would be
pure liability.

The change is **additive and flag-guarded**, which is the pattern this project already
prescribes and has already executed once: `--output kms` was added alongside `--output
wall` without disturbing the RP2350 path, and `--transport spi` survives as the proven
fallback. Do the same thing again.

```
rayglow:      feat/remote-render     # all work happens here
rayglow-fpga: (no branch)            # doc-only, direct small commit when proven
```

**Branch plan**
- Small commits at checkpoints; each phase in §6 is a natural commit boundary.
- Merge to `main` only once the wall runs on it *and* `--output kms` still works —
  the local-render path is the fallback and must not rot.
- `rayglow-fpga`: when proven, one commit — a ROADMAP status line plus an
  INTERFACE-CONTRACT bump to **v0.2** stating explicitly that the contract specifies DPI
  signals and timing and says nothing about which machine generates them. Small, correct,
  and it formalizes why no gateware work was needed.

**Deployment.** The repo already handles multi-machine roles (`sender/` is its own uv
project; `rayglow/` installs editable on the Pi). A third role is a *deployment* concern,
not a repo-structure one. Add a third mutagen session:

| Session | Alpha (desktop) | Beta |
|---|---|---|
| `rayglow-code` | `~/Projects/rayglow` | `rpi5:/home/will/rayglow` *(existing)* |
| `rayglow-shaders` | `~/Projects/rayglow-shaders` | `rpi5:/home/will/presets` *(existing)* |
| **`rayglow-render`** | `~/Projects/rayglow` | `ubuntu-server:/home/will/rayglow` *(new)* |
| **`rayglow-shaders-render`** | `~/Projects/rayglow-shaders` | `ubuntu-server:/home/will/presets` *(new)* |

The desktop stays the single source of truth — "edits here ARE the deploy" still holds,
now fanning out to two targets. Hot-reload keeps working; the watcher just runs on
ubuntu-server.

## 5. Latency analysis

The concern is legitimate and worth the arithmetic. The conclusion is that **the new
network hop is ~3% of the budget, and the change is a net latency *win*.**

### 5.1 Budget, 60 Hz DPI (recommended config — see §5.3)

**Audio front-end — unchanged by this project, and it dominates:**

| Stage | Latency | Note |
|---|---|---|
| PipeWire capture | ~5–11 ms | `blocksize=256, latency="low"` = 5.3 ms/quantum |
| FFT window group delay | **6 / 21 / 43 ms** | Hann centroid = window/2 (see 5.2) |
| Sender frame quantization (~60 Hz) | 0–17 ms, avg 8 | |
| **Subtotal** | **~19–36 ms typical** | up to ~60 ms if driven by `spec[]` |

**Transport + render — what this project changes:**

| Stage | Latency | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Feature UDP, desktop→ubuntu-server | ~0.2 ms | ~3 KB, one datagram, same VLAN, switched |
| **Render (RTX 4080)** | **~0.5–2 ms** | **vs 25–50 ms on the Pi today** |
| Frame serialize + UDP TX, 147 KB @ 1 GbE | ~1.4 ms | 1.18 ms wire + switch + stack |
| Pi reassemble | ~0.3 ms | ~17 jumbo datagrams |
| **Subtotal (this is the "new" cost)** | **~2.4–4 ms** | |

**Display pipeline — unchanged:**

| Stage | Latency | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Pi vblank wait | 0–16.7, avg 8.3 ms | pacing; unavoidable at 60 Hz |
| Blit | ~0.15 ms | 196 KB memcpy |
| DPI frame + FPGA buffer swap on VSYNC | ~16.7 ms | one source frame |
| HUB75 BCM refresh @ 140.4 Hz | 0–7.1, avg 3.6 ms | |
| **Subtotal** | **~29 ms avg** | |

**Total ≈ 50–70 ms typical.**

### 5.2 The dominant term is the FFT, and you can choose it per shader

A Hann-windowed FFT's group delay is the window centroid — half the window:

| Window | Duration | Group delay | Feeds |
|---|---|---|---|
| 576 (→1024-pt) | 12.0 ms | **6.0 ms** | `bass`/`mid`/`treb`, bands **b4–b7** |
| 2048 | 42.7 ms | **21.3 ms** | `sub`, `sub_att` |
| 4096 | 85.3 ms | **42.7 ms** | `spec[128]`, `chroma[12]`, bands **b0–b3** |

This is time-frequency uncertainty, not an engineering defect: you cannot resolve 11.7 Hz
bins without observing 85 ms of signal. But it is *selectable*, and that is free latency:

> **Shader-authoring guideline: drive fast motion from b4–b7 / `bass`/`mid`/`treb`
> (6 ms), and reserve `spec[]`, `chroma[]`, and b0–b3 (43 ms) for slow or ambient
> parameters — color washes, background drift.** A shader whose transients ride the
> 576-window bands is ~37 ms tighter than one riding `spec[]`, for zero cost.

### 5.3 ⚠ Finding: stay at 60 Hz DPI. Do **not** bundle the 120 Hz upgrade.

The ROADMAP carries 120 Hz DPI as an open item, and it looks like an easy latency win
(halves both the vblank wait and the DPI frame, ~8.3 ms total). **It is likely a
regression, and the evidence is already in your own measurements.**

The wall's scan engine was tuned against the *ratio* of refresh to source cadence.
ROADMAP records `~117.9 Hz / 77.2 % duty / ~1.97× source cadence` as a tuning target, and
the streak/interleave artifact at line 241 was diagnosed as a source frame "straddling two
scan frames." Production today is **140.4 Hz refresh against 60 Hz source = 2.34×**.

Move the source to 120 Hz and that ratio becomes **1.17×**. Source frames would display
for either one or two refreshes in an uneven pattern — a 100% swing in dwell time versus
the current 50% swing. That is a strong candidate for reintroducing exactly the cadence
artifact that was already fought and fixed.

Holding ≥2× at a 120 Hz source needs ≥240 Hz refresh. You are at 140.4 Hz with a
**measured** SI cliff (24 MHz shift clean, 30 MHz cascades skew), so ~1.7× more scan
bandwidth is not available without solving signal integrity first.

**Trade:** 8.3 ms saved out of a ~60 ms budget (~13%) against a probable judder
regression. Bad trade. Keep 60 Hz. Revisit only as a separate experiment gated on refresh
reaching ~240 Hz.

*(Aside for whenever 120 Hz is attempted: there are reports of RP1 DPI clock instability
right around 25 MHz — the 25–27 MHz range — fixed by a patch merged into 6.6.y.
384×128@120 lands almost exactly there. Confirm the Pi's kernel before blaming the FPGA.)*

### 5.4 Comparison with today

| | Today (heavy shader, 60 Hz DPI) | Proposed |
|---|---|---|
| Audio front-end | 19–36 ms | 19–36 ms |
| Render | **25–50 ms** | **0.5–2 ms** |
| Network (frames) | — | 1.7 ms |
| Display pipeline | 29 ms | 29 ms |
| **Total** | **~73–115 ms** | **~50–70 ms** |

**Net: 20–45 ms faster.** The render collapse dwarfs the added hop. Even for a trivial
shader that already hits the 60 Hz cap on the Pi, the new path is no worse — the extra
1.7 ms of wire disappears into the vblank wait that was already being spent.

### 5.5 ⚠ The real risk is queueing, not transit

Transit time is fine. **Unbounded buffering is the trap that will actually bite.** A naive
`while True: render(); send(frame)` on a 4080 will produce 500+ fps into a link consuming
60, socket buffers fill, and end-to-end latency grows without bound — classic bufferbloat.
It will look like "the visuals drift further behind the music the longer it runs."

**Mitigation — credit-based flow control, mirroring the RP2350 READY handshake already
built for the PIO link:**

- The Pi's blit loop is already vblank-paced by `_VBlank.wait()`. After each blit it emits
  a one-datagram credit.
- The render host holds N credits and blocks when out.
- **The Pi's vblank becomes the master clock for the entire pipeline.** At most N frames
  in flight; latency bounded at N × 16.7 ms.
- Start at **N=2** (one frame of slack absorbs network jitter), try N=1 once stable.

This also stops the renderer free-running at 500 fps, which would burn GPU and heat the
box running Frigate for frames nobody sees.

**Transport: UDP, not TCP.** A single lost packet under TCP stalls the whole stream for a
retransmit timeout (Linux RTO min ~200 ms) — catastrophic for a visualizer. Under UDP a
lost packet costs one frame; the Pi re-displays the last good one and it is invisible at
60 Hz. This is the same reasoning already documented for the audio feed: *"a lost or late
packet just means the Pi renders with the previous values."* Use a per-frame sequence
number + fragment index, drop incomplete frames, latest-wins.

**Enable jumbo frames** (MTU 9000 on the Pi, the VM vNIC, and the 3850): 147 KB becomes
~17 datagrams instead of ~100, cutting per-packet overhead and interrupt load on the Pi.

### 5.6 Four independent clocks

Desktop audio (48 kHz DAC), ubuntu-server render pacing, Pi DPI vblank (RP1 PLL), and
FPGA refresh (its own PLL off the 12 MHz FTDI reference) are **four free-running clocks**.
They will drift. Every stage must be latest-wins or credit-paced so drift produces a
repeated or dropped frame, never a growing queue. The FPGA already tolerates DPI/refresh
asynchrony by design. Don't chase this as a bug when it shows up as an occasional
duplicated frame.

### 5.7 The compensation you already have

`beat.py` is a **predictive** tracker — `beat_phase` is described as an *"anticipatory
0→1 ramp hitting 1.0 ON the predicted beat."* That is a latency-compensation mechanism
already in the codebase. Adding a signed constant offset lets beat-locked content render
*ahead* of the audio by the measured pipeline depth, driving effective sync toward zero
regardless of the ~60 ms transport budget.

**But measure the net offset, don't minimize the visual path blindly.** The audio you
*hear* is also delayed — if monitoring through the Denon AVR (192.168.2.130), AV receivers
commonly add 30–90 ms of DSP latency, which can exceed the entire visual pipeline. In that
case the visuals are already running *ahead* and want delaying, not advancing.

> **Expose a signed `--latency-comp <ms>` knob, tune it by eye against the actual
> listening setup, and record per-output-path values.** This is worth more than any
> further micro-optimization of the transport.

## 6. Work breakdown

Each phase is independently testable and a natural commit boundary.

### Phase 0 — Headless EGL on NVIDIA *(blocker; do first, it de-risks everything)*
`rayglow/render/egl.py:304` hardcodes `EGL_PLATFORM_SURFACELESS_MESA` (0x31DD), a
Mesa-only platform NVIDIA's proprietary driver does not implement. Add an
`EGL_PLATFORM_DEVICE_EXT` (0x313F) path via `eglQueryDevicesEXT` +
`eglGetPlatformDisplayEXT`, selected at runtime with the Mesa path as fallback.

- Keep **GLES3, not desktop GL 4.6** — costs nothing on NVIDIA and preserves Mesa/Pi
  dry-runs, which is worth more than any GL 4.x feature here.
- Needs `libEGL.so.1` + `libGLESv2.so.2` on the ubuntu-server *host* (libglvnd + driver);
  Frigate's Docker/NVIDIA-container-toolkit setup does not put them there by itself.
- **Accept:** `python -m rayglow.render <shader> --dry-run 120 --no-listen` produces a
  correct GIF on ubuntu-server with no X/Wayland running, and `GL_RENDERER` reports the
  4080.

### Phase 1 — Audio feed retarget
Set `RAYGLOW_HOST=192.168.1.101` on the desktop. No code change.
- **Accept:** `milk-verbose.glsl` dry-run on ubuntu-server reacts to music playing on the
  desktop; all feature bars move.

### Phase 2 — Frame transport
New network sink on the render host; new `rayglow.framesink` module on the Pi (socket +
`KmsOut`, no GL). UDP, jumbo frames, seq + fragment index, drop incomplete, latest-wins.
Credit-based flow control with N=2.
- **Accept:** wall renders a known shader from ubuntu-server. `--output kms` still works
  on the Pi. Sustained run shows **no latency growth over 30 min** (the bufferbloat test —
  log observed frame age, it must be flat, not climbing).

### Phase 3 — Measurement and tuning
Instrument a stats line matching the existing convention (`fps render net wait`). Measure
real end-to-end latency (phone slow-mo of a percussive hit vs. the wall is sufficient and
honest). Tune `--latency-comp`.
- **Accept:** measured end-to-end within ~2× of the §5.1 budget; if not, the budget is
  wrong and gets revised here.

### Phase 4 — Reclaim the headroom
With ~950× the GPU, revisit what was previously unaffordable: `scale` back up, heavier
multipass, shaders that were shelved as too slow.
- **Accept:** at least one previously-unrunnable shader running at the 60 Hz cap.

### Phase 5 — PoE consolidation *(independent; can happen any time)*
See §7.

## 7. Infrastructure notes

**VLAN — resolved.** The Pi currently sits on `192.168.2.113` (IoT VLAN 20) only because
VLAN 10 was reserved for wired devices. Moving it to the unused wired port in the display
room puts it on VLAN 10 alongside ubuntu-server, so the ~71 Mbit/s frame stream (142 at
120 Hz, should that ever happen) stays L2
on the 3850's switch fabric and never hairpins through the OPNsense VM. **This must happen
before Phase 2** — do not benchmark the transport across the VLAN boundary and draw
conclusions from it.

**PoE.** The room's second port can carry both power and data. The switch is not the
limit: WS-C3850-24XU-S is **60 W/port UPOE, 580 W system budget**; nine Reolinks at ~6 W
leave ~500 W spare. Load is ~30 W (headless Pi 5 ~8–12 W, ECP5-EVN at 12 V ~1–1.5 A).

- **A PoE HAT is impossible** — the 40-pin header is fully occupied by the DPI ribbon to
  JP8, mechanically before electrically. Power must arrive by USB-C.
- Topology: one UPOE run → 12 V splitter at the wall → 12 V direct to the EVN barrel, plus
  a 12 V→5 V **synchronous** buck → USB-C to the Pi.
- **Do not use the LM2596 stock for the Pi** — non-synchronous, 3 A ceiling, ~75%
  efficient, poor transient response, against a load with sharp current steps.
- Cisco UPOE is pre-802.3bt 4-pair 60 W; a generic 802.3bt Type 3 splitter may negotiate
  down to 25.5 W if LLDP doesn't line up, which is tight against 30 W. Either measure what
  a bt splitter actually delivers, or use two guaranteed 802.3at splitters (12 V for the
  FPGA, 5 V USB-C for the Pi) at the cost of a second drop.
- **On the historical undervolt:** fatter all-copper cable fixes IR drop, which was
  probably not the root cause. The Pi was on the same 5 V rail as a 24-panel HUB75 wall —
  a violently pulsed load (BCM switching at 140 Hz, tens of amps at fast edges) that dips
  the rail and moves the shared ground reference. No amount of copper fixes sharing a rail
  with that. PoE fixes it correctly because PoE is **transformer-isolated (1500 Vrms per
  spec)**: the Pi gets an independent supply and its own ground reference, and grounds bond
  at exactly one controlled point — which is what the star scheme in
  `rayglow/hardware/POWER-AND-GROUNDING.md` already does.

## 8. Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Unbounded queueing → drifting latency | **High** | Credit-based flow control (§5.5); test explicitly in Phase 2 |
| NVIDIA EGL device platform doesn't come up headless | Medium | Phase 0 is first precisely so this fails cheap |
| Pathological shader hangs the GPU → driver reset kills Frigate's TensorRT context | Medium | Bound every march loop with a constant iteration cap. Compute sharing is safe; *fault* sharing is not. This is the one honest argument for a dedicated render box instead of the camera server. |
| 120 Hz DPI cadence regression | Medium | Don't do it (§5.3) |
| Wall now depends on ubuntu-server being up | Low | `--output kms` local render stays as fallback — keep it working |
| Jumbo frames misconfigured on one hop → silent fragmentation | Low | Verify with `ping -M do -s 8972` end to end |

## 9. Open questions

1. Where should the frame protocol live — extend `rayglow/feed/` (which already owns
   packet framing and latest-wins semantics), or a new `rayglow/link/`? The feed module's
   philosophy transfers cleanly; the payload size does not.
2. Should the Pi's `framesink` be a separate console entry point, or `--output kms
   --source net` on the existing module? The Pi no longer needs the GL stack at all, which
   argues for a separate, dependency-light module.
3. Does the control plane (TCP :5006 — shader switch/push, media controls) move to
   ubuntu-server with the renderer? Almost certainly yes, since it controls rendering. Confirm
   nothing on the Pi side depends on it.
4. Is `scale=2` still the right default with ~950× the GPU, or is the LED wall's real
   limit elsewhere (panel pitch, BCM depth)? Phase 4 should answer empirically rather than
   assuming more supersampling is better.

## 10. Prior art in this project

Three patterns here already exist and should be reused rather than reinvented:

- **Credit/READY flow control** — the RP2350 PIO link self-paces off a READY line.
  Same idea, different wire.
- **Latest-wins packet semantics** — the audio feed already drops late packets rather than
  queueing them. Same idea, bigger payload.
- **Additive flag-guarded transports** — `--transport spi` survived the PIO bus and
  `--output wall` survived `--output kms`. Same idea, third instance.
